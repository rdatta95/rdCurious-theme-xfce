# rdCurious-theme-xfce
A custom theme for xfce4 and xfwm4

## Why?
I just want to experience writing a theme for my setup from scratch.
Looks fun

This project is heavily inspired from: [addy-dclxvi/xfwm4-theme-collections](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/xfwm4-theme-collections)
This project is intended to be a learning experience (Also, I hope I end up with something that I enjoy using)

## How to use:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run the `setup.sh` script
	1. This will create a symlink to this directory inside ~/.themes/
3. Change wm theme to `rdCurious` from Window Manager settings
